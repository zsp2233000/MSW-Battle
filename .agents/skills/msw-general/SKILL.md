# MSW General — Foundation Skill

The foundation skill for MSW (MapleStory Worlds) creation, integrating **shared tools, domain knowledge, platform rules, and file authoring**. Every other MSW skill depends on it.

---

## Core Principle: Visual Polish

MSW is a **game creation platform**. The goal is not a prototype where logic merely runs — it is a **polished game** players can enjoy.

So whatever entity you create — monster, NPC, tower, item, background object — search for and apply **appropriate resources (sprites, animations, sounds)** that match its role and personality. Do not leave the default sprite in place or leave `SpriteRUID` empty.

**Resource application principle when creating an entity:**

1. After creating the entity, use the **`msw-search` skill** to find sprites/animations that fit it
2. Apply the RUID of the found resource to `SpriteRendererComponent` so the entity is **visually represented**
3. If there is combat, also set hit/explosion effects; if there is interaction, set sound effects

> **Functionality implemented != finished.** A polished game requires appropriate resources plus visual presentation.

## When making a `.model` — catalog first

Do not start a new `.model` from an empty file. **The skill-local `models/` folder contains validated templates organized by category** — monsters (`ChaseMonster`/`MoveMonster`/`StaticMonster`), NPC (`StaticNPC`), players (`Player`/`DefaultPlayer`), terrain (`Foothold`/`Ladder`/`Rope`/`Portal`), map objects (`MapObject`/`SkeletonMapObject`/`ItemAsset`), particles (`BasicParticle`/`SpriteParticle`/`AreaParticle`/`AnimationPlayer`), sound (`Sound`/`SoundEffect`), tile map containers (`TileMap`/`RectTileMap`), UI (`UIButton`/`UIText`/`UISprite`/`UIGroup`, etc.), external media (`WebSprite`/`YoutubePlayerWorld`).

**Workflow**: **`Read` [references/model.md](references/model.md) IN FULL FIRST (mandatory — see "Model Work Preflight — MUST" below)** → pick the closest template from the catalog → load it via `ModelBuilder` (call protocol: [`references/builder-protocol.md`](references/builder-protocol.md) core + [`references/builder-protocol-model.md`](references/builder-protocol-model.md)) → replace the 3 identifiers (`EntryKey`, `Id`, `Name`) through the builder → customize `Components`/`Values`/`Properties`/`Children` through the builder → **save under a typed subfolder of `RootDesk/MyDesk/Models/`** (e.g. `Models/Monsters/{Name}.model`, never directly under `MyDesk/`) → `refresh`. Detailed catalog and builder procedure: [references/model.md §2](references/model.md).

> The builder emits the required value metadata, so agents do not need to read or hand-write `.model` format internals.

> **For a monster, first pick a pattern in [references/animation-state.md §0](references/animation-state.md), then follow [references/monster.md §5](references/monster.md) for the recommended path.**
> - **Pattern A (verified working canonical — Soldier reference setup, full source inlined in [`references/monster.md` §7](references/monster.md))**: no template needed; assemble 11 components from scratch with a custom `script.MyMonsterAI` (SoldierAI-style) instead of AIChase/AIWander. `StateComponent.IsLegacy` left at the default.
> - **Pattern B (`MonsterCanonical.model`)**: `AIChaseComponent` + `ActionSheet` pipeline. `StateComponent.IsLegacy=false` mandatory. The other monster templates (`ChaseMonster` / `MoveMonster` / `StaticMonster`) leave `ActionSheet` empty and use defaults that silently fail under Pattern B (uppercase keys, `SortingLayer="Default"`, `IsLegacy=true`).
>
> **For any entity that has `StateAnimationComponent` (monster/NPC) or `AvatarStateAnimationComponent` (player) — or any `.mlua` that calls `ChangeState` / `AddState` / `SetActionSheet` — also read [references/animation-state.md](references/animation-state.md).** The state-machine ↔ animation pipeline, the two-pattern split, default-state registration rules, `[LEA-3005]` cause, and `SetActionSheet` vs `ChangeState` semantics live there (not duplicated into per-entity docs).

## Placing multiple entities — model first

If the same entity is going to appear **twice or more in a map** (5 monsters, 10 trees, 3 portals, …), **author a `.model` first and place each instance via `modelId`** rather than copy-pasting inline `@components`.

| Instance count of same composition | Choice |
|---|---|
| **1** (truly one-off decoration in a single map) | inline `@components` is acceptable |
| **≥2** | **`.model` + `modelId` instances (default)** |
| Spawned at runtime (`SpawnByModelId`) | `.model` is required regardless of count |

**Why this is the default:**

- **Edit once, propagate everywhere** — change `SpriteRUID`/HP/`ActionSheet` in the model and every instance updates. Inline copies require touching N entities each time.
- **Smaller, reviewable `.map` diffs** — `modelId` instances carry only `Transform` overrides; inline copies bloat the map by hundreds of lines per entity.
- **Avoids drift** — five inline copies silently diverge (one gets `IsLegacy: true`, another forgets `SortingLayer: "MapLayer0"`). The model anchors the canonical values.
- **Required for `SpawnByModelId`** — without a registered model id, dynamic spawning fails.

**Workflow**:
1. Author `.model` under `RootDesk/MyDesk/Models/{Category}/{Name}.model` (see folder rule above).
2. Place each instance via `MapBuilder` (call protocol: [`references/builder-protocol.md`](references/builder-protocol.md) core + [`references/builder-protocol-map.md`](references/builder-protocol-map.md)) so ids, paths, `componentNames`, origin metadata, and per-instance component overrides stay synchronized.
3. `refresh`.

Details and the inline-vs-modelId comparison: [references/entity.md "Two-Step Map Editing Workflow"](references/entity.md), [references/model.md §1](references/model.md).

## Preflight read semantics — applies to every "MUST Read" in this skill

"Read X FIRST" in the preflights and Absolute Principles means: **X must be fully in context before the work starts** — not "re-read X every turn". `Read` the file IN FULL (no `offset`/`limit`, no `cat`/`Get-Content`) **only if** it was never loaded this session or was lost to context compaction. Do **not** re-read a file that is already fully in context — presence in context is the requirement; re-reading is waste. Memory or a summary of a file does **not** count as the file being in context, and a prior turn having loaded it does not exempt this turn from confirming it is still there.

---

## Entity Work Preflight — **MUST**

If the task involves an entity in any way, **you must read [references/entity.md](references/entity.md) first.** No exceptions.

---

## Builder Protocol Preflight — **MUST**

If the task **creates or modifies any `.map` / `.model` / `.ui` file** — directly, or as a side effect of writing `.mlua` that spawns / places / binds — **[references/builder-protocol.md](references/builder-protocol.md) (core) plus the per-builder file for each file type the task mutates — [references/builder-protocol-map.md](references/builder-protocol-map.md) (`.map`) / [references/builder-protocol-model.md](references/builder-protocol-model.md) (`.model`) / [references/builder-protocol-ui.md](references/builder-protocol-ui.md) (`.ui`) — must be fully in context FIRST** (read semantics above). No exceptions.

The protocol is one unified entry point split into a shared core (`builder-protocol.md` — routing, common workflow, chaining contract, §0 pre-flight, §4 cross-flow, §5 checklist) plus per-builder files (`builder-protocol-map.md` §1 / `builder-protocol-model.md` §2 / `builder-protocol-ui.md` §3). **Knowing only one builder's protocol and then invoking another builder's `.cjs` bypasses that builder's write-side contract** (`componentNames` sync, `Values` `typeKey` metadata, write-time auto-lint, `placeModel` component mirroring, child entity invariants) — the three are interlocked through cross-flow (model authoring → map placement → ui binding), so cross-flow work loads every matching per-builder file.

Triggers (intentionally broad — load the missing protocol file(s) whenever any match):

- `.map` changes (entity placement, component patching, tile / foothold inspection)
- `.model` changes (new authoring, value / component / property / child edits)
- `.ui` changes (new build, component CRUD, binding injection)
- Any call to `MapBuilder` / `ModelBuilder` / `UIBuilder`
- Requests shaped like "entity-shaped" work — monster / NPC / projectile / map object / popup / HUD, etc.
- Any code using `_SpawnService` (a spawnable model must be authored and placed first)

The domain refs (`entity.md` / `model.md` / `msw-ui-system` design references) are read **alongside** the protocol files — they are not substitutes (domain context + call protocol are a pair). **Confirm they are still in context on every turn that fires a trigger** — re-read only what was never loaded or was lost to compaction.

---

## Model Work Preflight — **MUST**

If the task involves authoring or editing a `.model` file in **any** way — including any call to `ModelBuilder` (any API), creating a new model from a template, mutating components/values/properties/children/event links on an existing model, or even a one-line tweak — **[references/model.md](references/model.md) must be fully in context FIRST** (read semantics above). No exceptions.

The builder's template catalog, the 3-identifier replacement rule (`EntryKey` / `Id` / `Name`), required value metadata, property/child/event-link API surface, and the typed save-folder layout under `RootDesk/MyDesk/Models/` live only in [`references/model.md`](references/model.md). Calling the builder without reading [`references/model.md`](references/model.md) first silently produces broken models (missing value metadata, mismatched identifiers, wrong save folder, default-value silent failures). Reading scattered template files or guessing the API from memory is **not a substitute** — at the start of every turn that touches a `.model`, confirm it is still in context and re-read only if it was lost.

---

## Map Work Preflight (do this BEFORE any map work)

Before starting **any** map-related task — entity placement, spawn, movement scripts, model authoring, tile edits, etc. — you **must** complete these two steps in order:

1. **Identify the target map** — its path (`./map/{mapname}.map`), its root entity, and its location in the Hierarchy.
2. **Use `MapBuilder` to read `MapComponent.TileMapMode` as a number** (call protocol: [`references/builder-protocol.md`](references/builder-protocol.md) core + [`references/builder-protocol-map.md`](references/builder-protocol-map.md)). Keep the value in mind for the rest of the session.

| Value | Mode | Required Body | Runtime log on mismatch / missing Body |
|:--:|---|---|---|
| `0` | **TileMap** (MapleTile, side-view + Foothold) | `RigidbodyComponent` | `[LEA-3004] MissingComponent : Entity is missing 'RigidbodyComponent'.` |
| `1` | **RectTileMap** (RectTile, top-down) | `KinematicbodyComponent` | `[LEA-3004] MissingComponent : Entity is missing 'KinematicbodyComponent'.` |
| `2` | **SideViewRectTileMap** (SideViewRectTile, side-view tile) | `SideviewbodyComponent` | `[LEA-3004] MissingComponent : Entity is missing 'SideviewbodyComponent'.` |

**Never start map work without knowing the current `TileMapMode`.** The three modes differ completely in Body component, gravity, collision, and event stacks. A mismatch is almost never a compile-time error — it shows up either as a silent failure (entity doesn't move / passes through walls / invisible) or as one of the three `[LEA-3004] MissingComponent` runtime logs above. Whenever you see one of those three messages, suspect a **TileMapMode ↔ entity Body mismatch** first.

### Recommending the right mode — **MUST** when starting a new map or when the current mode is clearly wrong for the user's goal

Whenever the user describes what game / map they want to build (new map authoring, "make a side-scroller", "I want a top-down dungeon", or you read the current `.map` and find its `TileMapMode` does **not** fit the user's intended gameplay), you **must explicitly recommend the appropriate `TileMapMode` to the user and explain why** before proceeding with any further entity / model / script work.

Use this decision matrix as the source of truth:

| User's intended game / gameplay | Recommend | Why |
|---|---|---|
| MapleStory-style side-scrolling action · jump · ladder · freely placed footholds (platformer) | **`0` MapleTile** | Side-view + gravity, `FootholdComponent` line-segment platforms — non-grid, freely placed platforms |
| Top-down RPG · maze · board game · dungeon crawler · Bomberman-style · RTS-style · farming sim | **`1` RectTile** | Top-down 4-directional free move, no gravity, square-tile grid |
| Tile-based side-scrolling platformer · Mario-style pixel action · side-view puzzle (square-tile side-view) | **`2` SideViewRectTile** | Side-view + gravity **on a tile grid** (not freely placed footholds) |

**Procedure:**

1. If the user has not yet told you what kind of game they want, **ask** before recommending a mode (one short question is enough — e.g. "Is it top-down, or side-scrolling (jump/ladder)? And is the terrain based on freely placed footholds, or a square tile grid?").
2. Once the intent is clear, **state the recommendation** (mode number + name + one-sentence rationale) and the matching Body / map component the user will need ([`platform.md` §4 mapping table](references/platform.md)).
3. **Lock the choice in early** — switching `TileMapMode` later wipes terrain, forces every Body / movement script to be re-checked, and may force re-painting all tiles ([`platform.md` §4 "Cautions When Switching Map Type"](references/platform.md)).

### Changing `TileMapMode` — **user action in Maker, not an AI file edit**

**The AI must never flip `MapComponent.TileMapMode` by editing the `.map` JSON directly.** Mode switching requires swapping tile components, rebuilding footholds, converting tile-data formats, and resetting terrain — all internal Maker operations.

**Guide the user to do this in the Maker editor:**

1. Open the Maker editor's **Hierarchy** window.
2. **Right-click the target map entity** in the Hierarchy.
3. From the context menu, **choose the "Switch ..." option that matches the target mode** (Switch TileMap / RectTileMap / SideViewRectTileMap). Maker performs the conversion, swaps the tile component, and resets terrain as needed.
4. After the user confirms the switch is complete, call MCP **`refresh`**, then re-read `MapComponent.TileMapMode` to verify and re-check every dynamic entity's Body component against the new mode.

> The AI's role in mode changes: **recommend → wait for user to right-click-switch in Maker Hierarchy → refresh → fix Body components / scripts that no longer match.** Never write a new value to `TileMapMode` from a file edit.

The table above is a summary. **The mode-switch procedure, the post-Body-swap checklist, and the silent-failure symptom dictionary beyond LEA-3004** live only in [`references/platform.md` §4](references/platform.md) (mapping + check protocol + switching policy) and [`references/troubleshooting.md`](references/troubleshooting.md) (full symptom dictionary) — **you must Read them** when changing modes / swapping Body / debugging silent failures.

## Platform Rules Preflight — **MUST** when any of these triggers fire

If **any** of the following triggers matches your task, `Read` the corresponding reference **before** editing code or proposing a plan. These triggers are intentionally broad — when in doubt, read. The "8 Core Rules" in this SKILL.md are a summary only; the **symptom→cause→fix tables, per-map-type code patterns, the `MovementComponent` conversion formulas, and SortingLayer/SpriteRUID details live only in references**.

| Trigger (keyword / situation) | File to read |
|---|---|
| jump, gravity, movement, `MoveVelocity`, `InputSpeed`, `JumpForce`, `WalkSpeed`, `SpeedFactor`, foothold, patrol | **The matching map type's** [`references/platform-maple.md`](references/platform-maple.md) / [`platform-rect.md`](references/platform-rect.md) / [`platform-sideview.md`](references/platform-sideview.md) (in full) **+** [`references/platform.md`](references/platform.md) §10 |
| spawn / `_SpawnService` / `SpawnByModelId` / `SpawnByEntity` / "summon a monster" / "runtime creation" | [`references/platform.md`](references/platform.md) §8 + §8.5 |
| Screen coordinates / camera range / "is it on screen" / "pixel units" / OrthographicSize / world unit | [`references/platform.md`](references/platform.md) §5 |
| Occluded / invisible / "should render on top" / SortingLayer / OrderInLayer / Z value | [`references/platform.md`](references/platform.md) §6 + §7 |
| `LEA-3004` in the log / "won't move" / "floating in mid-air" / "stuck in wall" / "bouncing off" / "disappears off the map" / "falls off the foothold edge" | **[`references/troubleshooting.md`](references/troubleshooting.md) (in full) first**, then the matching map type's `platform-{type}.md` §7 |
| `LEA-3005 InvalidArgument 'stateName'` / `StateComponent` / `StateType` / `@State` / `ChangeState` / `AddState` / `AddCondition` / `ActionSheet` / `SetActionSheet` / `StateAnimationComponent` / `AvatarStateAnimationComponent` / `StateChangeEvent` / "animation doesn't change" / "stays in stand/idle while moving" / "attack pose never plays" / "hit anim loops" / monster·NPC·player animation state work | **[`references/animation-state.md`](references/animation-state.md) (in full) first**, then [`references/monster.md`](references/monster.md) (or the entity-specific doc) for entity-level composition |
| shader / material / outline / glow / blur / pixelate / rainbow / tint / grayscale / vignette / screen filter / lens distortion / wave / ripple / distortion / dissolve / additive / blend mode / hologram / mask / post-process / `MaterialID` / `MaterialId` / `ChangeMaterial` / `_MaterialService` / `.material` file | **[`references/material.md`](references/material.md) (in full)** — then drive shader catalog / property names / per-component compatibility via `mlua_Document_Retriever` + `mlua_API_Retriever` MCP lookups (do NOT memorize) |
| New map setup / new project / `.config` / CoreVersion verification / sector registration / folder metadata Refresh | [`references/platform.md`](references/platform.md) §2 + §15 + §16 |
| MapleTile (`TileMapMode = 0`) work — Foothold, `Gravity`, `WalkSpeed`, `PredictFootholdEnd` | [`references/platform-maple.md`](references/platform-maple.md) (in full) |
| RectTile (`TileMapMode = 1`) work — `SpeedFactor`, 4-directional movement, Movable tiles, dynamic tiles | [`references/platform-rect.md`](references/platform-rect.md) (in full) |
| SideViewRectTile (`TileMapMode = 2`) work — `JumpSpeed`/`JumpDrag`, wall detection (`Normal`), `EnableDownJump` | [`references/platform-sideview.md`](references/platform-sideview.md) (in full) |

> If two or more triggers match, read **all** of them. "I already saw the 8 Core Rules in SKILL.md" is not an excuse for skipping references.

---

## 8 Core Rules (must memorize)

1. If you don't align **TileMapMode ↔ Body mapping**, the entity will not move (no error) or raises `[LEA-3004] MissingComponent` at runtime → [`references/platform.md` §4](references/platform.md) (or if approaching by symptom, [`references/troubleshooting.md`](references/troubleshooting.md))
2. User scripts only work as a `.mlua` + `.codeblock` **pair** — `.codeblock` is generated by Maker Refresh
3. If `SpriteRUID` is an empty string, the entity is **invisible on screen** (no error)
4. When calling `SpawnByModelId`, not passing a map entity (`self.Entity.CurrentMap`) as `parent` causes a runtime error
5. Coordinates are in **world units** (1 unit = 100 px). Pixel values are off by 100x
6. Maker only scans `RootDesk/` — user files placed in `Global/` will not be recognized
7. **Do not modify** `.d.mlua` or `.codeblock`.
8. CoreVersion is `26.7.0.0` — do not work if there is a mismatch

## Absolute Principles (apply to every task)

0. **If the task involves an entity, read [references/entity.md](references/entity.md) first.** No exceptions.
0-bis. **If the user's request mentions any UI element** (popup, HUD, button, toast, panel, dialog window, menu, tab, layout, screen, bar/gauge, slot) **OR involves writing/editing `.ui` files**, **BEFORE proposing any plan, options, or questions to the user**:
   1. **Invoke `msw-ui-system` via the `Skill` tool first** — the single UI entry point (design judgment, component API, enums, layout recipes, runtime patterns, UUID binding, builder invocation protocol unified in one skill).
   2. **All `.ui` mutations must go through `msw-ui-system`'s `UIBuilder`** — no direct raw JSON editing or grep. Read existing `.ui` files via `UIBuilder`'s read-side API too. (Call protocol: [`references/builder-protocol.md`](references/builder-protocol.md) core + [`references/builder-protocol-ui.md`](references/builder-protocol-ui.md) §3.)
   3. (Optional) If you need UI pattern templates (simple popup, minimal HUD, multi-tab, shop flow), `Read`/`Glob` the files under `msw-ui-system/references/templates/` directly ([`templates.md`](../msw-ui-system/references/templates/templates.md) + `style-N-*/` + [`ruid-map.md`](../msw-ui-system/references/templates/style-1-black/ruid-map.md) + `Popupbutton.mlua`).
   No exceptions.
0-ter. **If the task will create, modify, rename, or delete ANY `.mlua` file** — including new scripts, edits to existing scripts, adding/removing a `Component`/`@Logic`/`@Event`/`@State`/`@BTNode`, wiring lifecycle methods (`OnBeginPlay`/`OnUpdate`/...), or even small one-line fixes — you **MUST `Read` BOTH [`msw-scripting/SKILL.md`](../msw-scripting/SKILL.md) AND [`msw-scripting/references/verify-checklist.md`](../msw-scripting/references/verify-checklist.md) IN FULL FIRST** (no `offset`/`limit`, no `cat`/`Get-Content`). Reading `msw-general` plus scattered `.d.mlua` files is **not a substitute**. This applies even when a previous turn already loaded `msw-scripting` — re-confirm at the start of the new turn. **Trigger phrases are intentionally broad**: if there is any chance the turn will touch a `.mlua`, treat it as triggered. No exceptions, no "I already know this", no shortcut via memory.
0-quater. **If the task involves spawning, movement, jump/gravity, coordinate placement, layer/order debugging, MapleTile/RectTile/SideViewRectTile-specific logic, OR you observe any silent-failure symptom (`[LEA-3004]` log, "won't move", "won't render", "floating in mid-air", "stuck in wall", "disappears off the map", "falls off the foothold edge", "100× off", "doesn't show in Maker", "client-only sync"), the matching `references/platform*.md` / [`references/troubleshooting.md`](references/troubleshooting.md) MUST be fully in context FIRST** (Read only if missing — see "Preflight read semantics"). **Additionally, if the symptom is animation/state-related (`[LEA-3005]` log, `'stateName' is not a valid argument`, animation doesn't match behavior, stuck in stand/idle clip while moving, attack pose never plays, hit loops, custom state never animates, anything touching `StateComponent` / `StateType` / `ChangeState` / `AddState` / `ActionSheet` / `SetActionSheet` / `StateAnimationComponent`), [`references/animation-state.md`](references/animation-state.md) MUST be fully in context FIRST** before any code or model edit. The 8 Core Rules in this SKILL.md are summary only — **the symptom→cause→fix tables, per-map-type code patterns (Foothold patrol / RectTile 4-directional movement / SideView wall detection), the `MovementComponent` InputSpeed conversion formula, SpriteRUID, SortingLayer/OrderInLayer detail, `SpawnByModelId` initialization order, folder metadata Refresh policy, and CoreVersion policy live only in references**. **Trigger phrases are intentionally broad**: if there is any chance the turn touches one of these areas, treat as triggered. For the matching `Read` targets, follow the trigger table in the "Platform Rules Preflight — MUST" section above. No exceptions, no "I already know this from the 8 Core Rules", no shortcut via memory.
1. **Visual polish** — never leave `SpriteRUID` empty. Use `msw-search` to find resources.
2. **`refresh` after content file changes that Maker must ingest** (if in play mode, `stop` first). Folder-only changes do not need immediate refresh.
3. **Never modify `Environment/*.d.mlua`** — API definitions are read-only.
4. **Never create `.codeblock` by hand** — Maker `refresh` generates it from `.mlua`. Folder metadata is also generated from real folders during refresh.
5. **Do not create new user files in `Global/`** — Maker will not recognize them. User files belong under `RootDesk/MyDesk/`.
6. **Structured files prefer builders, and the call manual is one unified entry point — a shared core plus per-builder files** — `.model` / `.ui` are builder-only; `.map` is builder-first. **The call protocol for all three builders — `MapBuilder` / `ModelBuilder` / `UIBuilder` — is consolidated in [`references/builder-protocol.md`](references/builder-protocol.md) (core) plus the per-builder files ([`builder-protocol-map.md`](references/builder-protocol-map.md) / [`builder-protocol-model.md`](references/builder-protocol-model.md) / [`builder-protocol-ui.md`](references/builder-protocol-ui.md)). The core + the file(s) matching the mutated types must be in context on every turn that mutates `.map` / `.model` / `.ui`** (see Builder Protocol Preflight). Direct raw JSON edits are allowed only in the coverage-gap areas explicitly listed in the per-builder files — minimal scope + `refresh` + logs verification.
7. **Entity reference binding (Entity/EntityRef property)** — the AI injects the UUID string directly. Do not ask the user to drag in Maker.
8. **Stop work on CoreVersion mismatch** — first verify `CoreVersion` in `Environment/config` is `26.7.0.0`.
9. **Call `screenshot` only when the user explicitly requests it.** Never call it automatically after task completion.
10. **If a workflow step fails mid-flow, stop later steps** — fix the root cause first.
11. **Two-or-more = make a model.** Whenever the same entity composition is placed ≥2 times in a map, author a `.model` first and instance it via `modelId`. Inline `@components` duplication is reserved for genuine one-off entities.
12. **Models live in typed subfolders.** Save new `.model` files under a category subfolder of `RootDesk/MyDesk/Models/` (e.g. `Models/Monsters/`, `Models/NPCs/`, `Models/Terrain/`, `Models/MapObjects/`, `Models/Particles/`, `Models/UI/`) — **never directly under `MyDesk/` or `Models/`**. When a needed subfolder does not exist, create the folder only; Maker Refresh will generate folder metadata later (see [references/platform.md §2](references/platform.md)).
13. **Translation is client-side only.** `_LocalizationService` and `Translator` methods (`GetText` / `GetTextFormat`) are all `ClientOnly`. For server-originated localized messages, send the key over RPC and let the client resolve it.
14. **Cross-platform tool selection — no shell for workspace exploration, use tools.** Use **the `Glob` / `Read` / `Grep` tools** for all workspace file/folder exploration, reading, and search. `Bash` commands like `ls` / `dir` / `Get-ChildItem` / `gci` / `cat` / `type` / `Get-Content` / `gc` / `head` / `tail` / `find` / `where` / `grep` / `findstr` / `Select-String` are **forbidden for workspace exploration** — they are not compatible across Windows (PowerShell/Git Bash) and macOS (bash/zsh), due to shell/path-handling differences (notably, in bash a path like `D:\path\foo` has its backslashes consumed as escapes and collapses to `D:pathfoo`). Use `Bash` only for **actual shell programs (`git` / `npm` / MCP / build scripts)**, and even then: (a) prefer **workspace-relative paths**, (b) if an absolute path is unavoidable, use **forward slashes + double quotes** (`"D:/path/to/map/"`, never pass `D:\...` form), (c) use **POSIX commands** only (`ls` / `mv` / `cp` / `rm`). If you see an error like `ls: cannot access 'D:path...': No such file or directory`, stop immediately and retry via `Glob` / `Read`.
15. **`.model` files are builder-only — and the builder requires [`references/model.md`](references/model.md) (domain) plus [`references/builder-protocol.md`](references/builder-protocol.md) core and [`references/builder-protocol-model.md`](references/builder-protocol-model.md) (call protocol) first.** Do not inspect or edit `.model` JSON directly. **Before using `ModelBuilder`, all of these documents must be fully in context** (read semantics above) — both "Model Work Preflight" and "Builder Protocol Preflight" fire. Identifier / value-metadata / property / child / event-link consistency is only guaranteed when they are read together.
16. **`.map` files are builder-first.** Use `MapBuilder` for covered inspection and mutation so entity ids, paths, component names, origin metadata, and model instance mirrors stay consistent. If `MapBuilder` explicitly does not cover the required operation, make the smallest direct `.map` edit possible, then `refresh` and verify. **Full API / require path / per-operation patterns / coverage gaps / `false`-return handling / cross-flow: [`references/builder-protocol-map.md`](references/builder-protocol-map.md) §1 + [`references/builder-protocol.md`](references/builder-protocol.md) §4** (read alongside [`references/entity.md`](references/entity.md) for domain context).
